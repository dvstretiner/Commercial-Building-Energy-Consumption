Data - "Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)" The Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) is a national sample survey that collects information on the stock of U.S. commercial buildings, including their energy-related building characteristics and energy usage data (consumption and expenditures).
Commercial buildings include all buildings in which at least half of the floorspace is used for a purpose that is not residential, industrial, or agricultural.
By this definition, CBECS includes building types that might not traditionally be considered commercial, such as schools, hospitals, correctional institutions, and buildings used for religious worship, in addition to traditional commercial buildings such as stores, restaurants, warehouses, and office buildings.
This project will be using the 2018 CBECS survey data to predict Annual Electricity Consumption in kWh. CBECS survey has been conducted since 1979, and over the years the variables and approach has changed.

2018 is the most recent year of the survey. Out of over 600 variables, roughly 70 were selected based on relevance to the response (domain knowledge) and with the aim to avoid redundancy (e.g., not selecting multiple variables that measure the same thing). Selected features could be summarized into the following categories:

1. Structural building characteristics: construction materials etc.
2. Capacity: number of seats, beds, roots etc.
3. Electrical equipment: computers, cash registers, servers
4. Types of HVAC equipment
5. Lighting
6. Regrigeration

--------------
This iteration of the project uses only 2018 data and produces point predictions. Currently in progress: combining 2018, 2012 and 2003 data and producing interval predictions.
